Foodâ€™s carbon footprint, or foodprint, is the greenhouse gas emissions produced by growing, rearing, farming, processing, transporting, storing, cooking and disposing of the food you eat. Worldwide, new reports suggest that livestock agriculture produces around a half of all man-made emissions.

## Problem: 
The food system is a major contributor to climate change, accounting for 25-30% of global greenhouse gas emissions.

## Cause: 
The production of animal-based foods, such as beef, lamb, and cheese, is particularly emissions-intensive. This is because livestock production requires large amounts of land, water, and energy, and also produces methane, a potent greenhouse gas.

## Effect:
The high carbon footprint of the food system is contributing to climate change, which is already having a significant impact on the planet, including more extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and loss of biodiversity.

In this project we explore the consumption and C02 emmission rates for various food types in numbers, highlighting specific regions as well (Eastern Africa Region) to shed light on the magnitude of the issue.
